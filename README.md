# actix-csrf

CSRF middleware for [actix-web] 4.0.0 or newer.

## Mitigation technique

Right now, the middleware will used token-based mitigations. In particular, double token
submit is implemented and I'd like to also use the synchronizer token pattern.

Please take a look at [https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md](here) for a lot of details.
In particular, it describes the conditions in which Double submit cookie is safer:
```
So, unless you are sure that your subdomains are fully secured and only accept HTTPS connections (we believe itâ€™s difficult to guarantee at large enterprises), you should not rely on the Double Submit Cookie technique as a primary mitigation for CSRF.
```

## Usage

Basic usage is

```rust
use actix_csrf::Csrf;
use actix_web::{HttpServer, web, App, HttpResponse};

// switch off during testing to not check CSRF
let enabled = true;

let server = HttpServer::new(move || {
    App::new()
        .wrap(Csrf::new().enable(enabled))
        .service(web::resource("/")
            // by default will not check get
            .route(web::get().to(|| HttpResponse::Ok()))
            // by default will check post
            .route(web::post().to(|| HttpResponse::Ok())))
});
```


## Roadmap

- More flexibility (add whitelist, other ways of extracting token)
- Implement synchronizer token pattern. This will most likely need the session middleware in combinaison with a template language such as askama.
- More testing
